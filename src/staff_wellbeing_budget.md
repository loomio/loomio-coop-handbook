# Staff Wellbeing Budget

We have a staff welfare budget line of $400 a month. The purpose is to contribute towards costs that would help alleviate stress and contribute to wellbeing of staff.

During the first week of each month, staff can email the coordinators with requests to use funds, and it will be at the discretion of the coordinators to allocate the funds. The coordinators will approve the use of funds in week 2 of a month. The use of the funds will be confidential.

The priority will be to allocate the funds to the greatest need, while also trying to spread the help around.

As a general rule, staff who have been granted the use of funds will pay up front for whatever they need, get a GST receipt and then submit it for reimbursement. If paying up front is an issue, other arrangements can be made (use of the Loomio credit card, or invoicing of Loomio).

If the monthly $400 amount is not spent, the excess will get rolled over to the next month.

The Well Working Group (WWG) can recommend to individuals that they apply to use the funds. The WWG will confirm if funds are available before recommending their use.
