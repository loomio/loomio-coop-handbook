# Purpose & Vision

**The Loomio Co-operative exists to create a world where itâ€™s easy for anyone to participate in decisions that affect them.**

With the right collaborative process, groups generate better ideas, decisions and actions than any individual would by themselves. The Loomio Co-operative aims to break down the barriers to participation in decision-making at every level: in neighbourhoods, community organisations, businesses, social movements, and local and national governance.

## Values

### Co-operative social enterprise

Loomio is a social enterprise collectively owned by the people building it. Unlike a traditional profit-maximising company, revenue is not an end in itself, but a means towards achieving a core social purpose. A worker-owned cooperative structure is a powerful way to live our values of collaboration and collective ownership.

### Independent and neutral

Loomio is committed to remaining independent so it can provide a neutral place for any group to come together.

### Open-source collaboration

Loomio aims to develop open-source tools that make collaboration accessible to everyone.

### Adaptive, reflexive, user-driven

Loomio aims to develop tools which are iterative, self-reflexive and adaptive, driven by the collective wisdom of the user community.

### Transparency

The Loomio Co-operative will be surrounded by a valued community of users and contributors. This community must be confident that the Loomio Co-operative is doing what it says it is. We are committed to high standards for sharing information.
