# The Loomio Way (Brand Guidelines)

A document to help content creators, bloggers and digital marketing outreach people at Loomio.

Key Questions:
*What type of language does the Loomio brand use?*
*How should I write when I’m writing for Loomio?*

## Writing as Loomio

**Hype vs Grounded**
It’s simple, effective technology built by good humans for good humans. We hype the stories of users and champions who use the tool to do amazing things. 

**Kiwi. But not too kiwi.** 
Embrace our kiwi roots and understated culture in the language tone overall, but avoid extreme ‘kiwi-isms’ that undermine clarity like ‘heaps, sweet, choice’ where possible.

**Avoid the ‘young-shiny-tech-kids-save-the-world’ vibe.** 
The tool is not everything, the tool is just the tool. It is effective software, not the holy grail. Avoid ‘digital native’ type language and skewing too far towards millennials.

**Write for inclusivity of sectors**

*“Our origin story is primarily about helping wranglers of purposeful groups from all sectors - some from activism, some from business."*

*“Our founding came from a meeting of activists and businesspeople realising they had similar needs around collaborative decision making.”*

**Un-official Theory of change:** 
High functioning small groups, being more effective & inclusive, can change organisational dynamics at a global scale. The process works because it’s grounded in powerful social technology - brought online and freed from having to be in the same place at the same time. Loomio breaks the trade-off between long slow participation and sharp, effective action. 


## Writing as Individuals about Loomio

Loomio is a tool about bringing diverse voices together, so it’s a great thing for individual communication written on behalf of Loomio to have an individual style (i.e. blog posts, public reports, interviews).

There are a few key qualities we might aim for to give our communication a level of consistency and coherence:

*Friendly, Straightforward, Accessible, Honest, Authentic, Human, Professional + Casual (not over polished or corporate), Feelings, Brief and clear, Open, Ambitious, Practical, Productive, Connected, Participatory, Effective, Inclusive, Slow+Fast (tradeoff breaker)*

Things to pay particular attention to:

* Frame your language as much as possible to be about benefits. 
* Use non-gendered language: ‘person’ not ‘guys’.
* Not politically charged. Loomio does have a social philosophy but we let the experience of using the tool speak for itself. It works because it’s baked in inherently.
* Get the details right. Check accuracy. Check spelling. Check grammar. Use proper attributions and check sources.
* Credibility about technology, open source, facilitation, and other specialty areas - make sure you use jargon right. Ask another team member if referring to a topic outside your area of expertise. (examples: free software, platform, open space, liquid democracy). 
* Non-violence. Avoid sarcasm, put downs, satire, insults. Look for positive, inclusive ways of making a point.
