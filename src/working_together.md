# Working together

## We use rhythms to balance freedom and focus

* our [purpose](purpose_and_vision.html) is our forever reason for being
* we do [strategy](strategy.html) to tell stories from 3 years in the future
* we do [planning](planning.html) every 3 months so everyone is focussed on the same thing
* we run [two-week sprints](sprints.html) to maintain agility, clarity, and accountability
* we self-organise into dynamic [working groups](working_groups.html) to address areas of work
* we have a collaborative process to [prioritise product development](product_prioritisation.html)


## The evolution of our organisational structure

### The swarm

In the earliest days of Loomio, we were organised as a "swarm" - we had open door meetings once a week, and anyone could rock up and help out. We ran a [tiny crowdfunding campaign](https://www.pledgeme.co.nz/projects/166-loomio), and founded an LLC so we could have a bank account.

In 2012, the core team committed to the project, and we formed a worker-owned cooperative. There were still a lot of people contributing on a casual part time basis, but there was also a group of full time people who became co-owners. We raised a round of loans from friends and family, and convened a board.

Internally, we were "self-organised" and it was somewhat chaotic, but it worked for extremely flexible adaptation and lots of learning quickly. We focused on peer-to-peer support systems like stewardship, and having regular retreats.

### Coordinated programs

In mid-2014, we completed a major [crowdfunding campaign](https://www.loomio.org/crowdfunding_celebration), which meant we suddenly had 1,600 new external stakeholders who were expecting us to deliver on our promises. This triggered us to develop a more explicit organisational structure.

We broke the team up into work programs, and nominated coordinators. Every program had a mandate to deliver a specific outcome, a share of the budget as allocated by the coop members, and a coordinator to maintain alignment within and between programs.

This system worked pretty well: we delivered on our crowdfunding promises and we learned a lot about how a democratic workplace can be super efficient.

### Embracing agile

Then we evolved again, and became a fully agile team. We had always drawn on elements of agile organising in our software development practices, but it was when we started incorporating all work across the co-op into agile sprints that it really clicked together.

Every 3 months we stop and reassess the team makeup, the coordinators, and the budget to check: are we still making the absolute best use of this money thatâ€™s been entrusted to us? This made us super adaptive and efficient, but of course it was really disruptive too.

In late 2015 we [raised money from impact investors](http://yesmagazine.org/new-economy/how-a-worker-owned-tech-startup-found-investors-and-kept-its-values-20160426), which finally brought us to a level of financial security where we could think more than 3 months ahead. This has enabled us to thinking long-term, resource a solid core team, and settle into a set of functional processes that address different perspectives and time-scales of our work.
