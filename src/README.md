## The Loomio Co-op Handbook


<img src='loomio-phone.png' class='img-right img-250px'>

The software we build is [open source](http://github.com/loomio/loomio), and our organisation is open source too. This handbook is where we document how we run an efficient organisation without a hierarchy.

We build software for collaborative decision making, used by thousands of organisations and communities around the world. If you‚Äôre looking for a way to make group decisions without meeting, try it out at [loomio.org](https://www.loomio.org?utm_campaign=handbook&utm_source=handbook).
