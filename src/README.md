## The Loomio Co-op Handbook

### An update for 2022
This handbook was written circa 2016. We preseve it here because it's a useful history of the organization at the time. 

In 2022, 10 years since Loomio launched, the team is smaller, but also more experienced. We're currently just 4 people in operational roles and 4 in advisory roles. We're still a worker-owned cooperative, and we're just as passionate about our work today as we were when this book was written - we've just changed how we work to suit our smaller team. We're proud of this handbook as it is, and hope you find something useful within.

If you're interested in using Loomio, you're welcome to try a demo or start a trial at [loomio.com](https://www.loomio.com).

If you've been following us for a long time, you might like to catch up with the current activities of the authors: [Alanna Irving](https://www.alanna.space) and [Richard Bartlett](http://richdecibels.com/).

The software we build is [open source](http://github.com/loomio/loomio), and our organisation is open source too. This handbook is where we document how we run an efficient organisation without a hierarchy.

We build software for collaborative decision making, used by thousands of organisations and communities around the world. If you‚Äôre looking for a way to make group decisions without meeting, try it out at [loomio.com](https://www.loomio.com?utm_campaign=handbook&utm_source=handbook).
