# Dev Tools

The code is managed through Github: [github.com/loomio/loomio](https://github.com/loomio/loomio).

You'll find lots of helpful information [in the docs folder](https://github.com/loomio/loomio/tree/master/docs/en).

We have developed a process to ensure knowledge about how our systems are running is up to date and access is shared properly, called the [Loomio devops bus test](https://hackmd.loomio.io/s/Sy-BIeRh)
