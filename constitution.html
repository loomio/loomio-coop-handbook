<h2 id="part-1--purpose"><a class="header" href="#part-1--purpose">PART 1 – PURPOSE</a></h2>
<p><strong>1.1 The Loomio Co-operative exists to create a world where it’s easy for anyone to participate in decisions that affect them.</strong></p>
<p>With the right collaborative process, groups generate better ideas, decisions and actions than any individual would by themselves. The Loomio Co-operative aims to break down the barriers to participation in decision-making at every level: in neighbourhoods, community organisations, businesses, social movements, and local and national governance.</p>
<p><strong>Co-operative social enterprise</strong>
The Loomio Co-operative is a social enterprise collectively owned by the people building it. Its principal activity is co-operative and not less than 60% of the voting rights in the Company will be held by its transacting shareholders. Unlike a traditional profit­maximising company, revenue is not an end in itself, but a means towards achieving a core social purpose. A worker-owned Co-operative structure is a powerful way to live our values of collaboration and collective ownership.</p>
<p><strong>Independent and neutral</strong>
The Loomio Co-operative is committed to remaining independent so it can provide a neutral place for any group to come together.</p>
<p><strong>Open-source collaboration</strong>
The Loomio Co-operative aims to develop open-source tools that make collaboration accessible to everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Adaptive, reflexive, user-driven</strong>
The Loomio Co-operative aims to develop tools which are iterative, self-reflexive and adaptive, driven by the collective wisdom of the user community.</p>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong>
The Loomio Co-operative will be surrounded by a valued community of users and contributors. This community must be confident that the Loomio Co-operative is doing what it says it is. The Loomio Co-operative is committed to high standards for sharing information and maintaining open books.</p>
<p><strong>1.2</strong> The Co-op is authorised to apply for registration as a Co-operative company under the Co-operative Companies Act 1996.</p>
<p><em>The relationship between the Constitution and the Co-operative Companies Act 1996</em>
<strong>1.3</strong> Loomio Co-operative Limited is registered under the Co-operative Companies Act 1996, the Companies Act 1993, and as such shall have the rights, powers, duties and obligations set out in the Co-operative Companies Act 1996, the Companies Act 1993 and this Constitution.
<strong>1.4</strong> The Company, the Board, each Director and each Shareholder have the rights, powers, duties and obligations set out in the Companies Act 1993 or the Co-operative Companies Act 1996 except to the extent that they are negated or modified by this Constitution.</p>

<li>In the case of any other formal meeting, the meeting is adjourned to the following week or to such other date, time and place as the directors agree, and, if at the adjourned meeting a quorum is not present within 30 minutes after the time appointed for the meeting, the shareholders or their proxies present are a quorum.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>14.8 Voting</strong>
In the case of a meeting of shareholders, unless a poll is demanded, voting shall be by whichever of the following methods is determined by the chairperson of the meeting:</p>

<p>14.8.3 In case of a meeting held by an electronic means under 14.6, by the votes placed on that electronic means. 14.8.4 In the case of a meeting of shareholders held by means of audio, audio and visual, or electronic communication, unless a poll is demanded, voting at the meeting shall be by the shareholders signifying individually their assent or dissent by voice.</p>
<p><strong>14.9 Polls</strong>
A declaration by the chairperson of the meeting that a resolution is carried by the requisite majority is conclusive evidence of that fact, unless a poll is demanded.</p>
<p>At a meeting of shareholders a poll may be demanded by:</p>
<p>14.9.1 Not less than 5 shareholders having the right to vote at the meeting;</p>
<p>14.9.2 A shareholder or shareholders representing not less than 10 per cent of the total voting rights of all shareholders having the right to vote at the meeting;</p>
<p>14.9.3 A shareholder or shareholders holding shares in the Company that confer a right to vote at the meeting and on which the aggregate amount paid up is not less than 10 per cent of the total amount paid up on all shares that confer that right; or</p>
<p>14.9.4 The chairperson of the meeting.</p>
<p>A poll may be demanded either before or after the vote is taken on a resolution.
If a poll is taken, votes must be counted according to the votes attached to the shares of each shareholder present in person or by proxy and voting.</p>
<p>The chairperson of a shareholders’ meeting is not entitled to a casting vote.
For the purposes of this clause, the instrument appointing a proxy to vote at a meeting of the Company confers authority to demand or join in demanding a poll and a demand by a person as proxy for a shareholder has the same effect as a demand by the shareholder.</p>
<p><strong>14.10 Proxies</strong></p>
<p>14.10.1 A shareholder may exercise the right to vote either by being present in person or by proxy. A proxy for a shareholder is entitled to attend and be heard at a meeting of shareholders as if the proxy is the shareholder. 14.10.2 A proxy must be appointed by notice in writing signed by the shareholder and the notice must state whether the appointment is for a particular meeting or a specified term.</p>
<p>14.10.3 No proxy is effective in relation to a meeting unless a copy of the notice of appointment is produced at least 48 hours before the start of the meeting.</p>
<p><strong>14.11 Vote before notice of revocation</strong>
A vote given in accordance with the terms of a notice of appointment of proxy is valid notwithstanding: 14.11.1 The previous death or insanity of the shareholder;</p>
<p>14.11.2 The revocation of the notice or of the authority under which the notice was executed; or 14.11.3 Transfer of the share in respect of which the notice is given.
If no notice in writing of the death, insanity, revocation, or transfer has been received by the Company at the registered office before the commencement of the meeting or adjourned meeting at which the notice is used, or presented at the meeting or adjourned meeting before the vote is given.</p>
