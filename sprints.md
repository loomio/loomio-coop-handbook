# Sprints
we run two-week sprints to maintain agility

Like a lot of software companies, we use an agile software development process known as “scrum” to coordinate our work. 

We break up the year into two-week chunks. Each chunk is called a sprint, though that is kind of a dumb name because it’s more about jogging at a sustainable pace, rather than sprinting as fast as we can and collapsing at some imaginary finish line.

###The Sprint Board

Probably the best way to understand it is to look at our [sprint board](https://trello.com/b/skuMQvLJ/loomio-sprint-board) on Trello.

**Inbox** is where you put stories that you think we should work on soon.

The backlog groomers get together fortnightly to consider these stories and decide if it is a priority (moving the card to **Next Up**) or not (**Backlog**).

The work for this Sprint is in the **Ready** column. The whole team decides which stories to bring into each sprint at Sprint Planning every second Tuesday.

When someone is working on a ticket, we put their face on it and move it to **In Progress**. 

At the top of the **Done** column is a **Sprint Summary** card. It includes our Sprint goals, notes about team Capacity, and the agenda for the Sprint Demo.

Our backlog is divided between **this quarter** and **not this quarter** so we can save good cards but not work on them straight away.


We move these Trello cards around at our regular sprint ceremonies:

Sprint planning happens on the first day of the sprint: Monday 10-11am. Everyone comes to this meeting where we agree sprint goals, check team capacity, agree stories we’re going to take on, and identify risks, and collectively commit to delivering all this work by next Friday.

Stand up happens every day from 10.15-10.30am (other than that first Monday). It’s a rapid fire conversation so everyone comes prepared with four pieces of information: what I did yesterday; what I'm doing today; any blocks that might stop me achieving today; what I'm doing to look after my wellbeing today.
 
Backlog grooming happens on the second Monday of the sprint from 3-4pm. This session is flexible, depending on what the team feels like is the best use of the time together. It is commonly used to review readiness of stories for the upcoming sprint; to review and "groom" the overall backlog to re-prioritise or delete stories if they're no longer required. The session can also be used to write new stories as a team. 

Sprint retrospective on the last day of the sprint: Friday 2-3pm. We stop and reflect on how the last two weeks have been, and collectively choose an improvement we want to focus on in the upcoming sprint.

Sprint demo is the last thing we do in any sprint: Friday 3-4pm. Drinks, snacks, and friends are welcome as we get together to celebrate everything we completed over the past two weeks: working software, new designs, amazing customer stories we’ve heard, new policies, or any other exciting news we want to share. At the end of the demo we close our computers knowing we are done for the weekend and there’s no outstanding work.
