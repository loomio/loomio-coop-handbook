# Stewarding

![](stewards2016.png)
Working without a boss is pretty great, but there are some useful things that a boss would normally do, for instance:

* make sure different teams are coordinated, and work connects up with the overall strategy
* when you’re new to a role, they’ll answer any questions you have
* they help you define and prioritise your ongoing work
* they’re the ones you talk to if your coworker is being a jerk
* they’ll support you to meet your personal development goals
* they’ll make sure you do the things you said you were going to do

A worker-owned co-op has the same need to fulfil these as any organisation. Over time, we’ve come up with ways to do that without resorting to the positional authority of a boss.

In the first place, we have coordinators to look after the day-to-day operations. Coordinators are the first port of call if you have questions about your work. You can find out more about coordinators [here](structure.md).

There’s a lot more to being in an organisation than just doing your daily tasks though, and for that stuff, we have invented the stewarding system.

## we have stewards for peer support

When you have an issue, you can’t approach a group; you need a specific person you know you can turn to. This is what your steward is for. They won’t solve every problem, but they are your point of contact to make sure the problem gets solved.

Stewarding is not about work, its about you as an individual, and your relationship to the co-op. They can be your mentor, or your guide, or your sounding board. If you ever get into a conflict situation, they’ll be on your side making sure you are well supported to a resolution.

Everyone working on Loomio should have a steward (if you don’t, talk to Rich!). Usually, all the members of the co-op are stewarding someone, which means there are lots of connections across the co-op and lots of opportunities for exchanging insights.


Most people meet with their stewards about once per month; you’ll probably find a rhythm that works for you. Your steward might ask you questions like:

* how was last month? what did you like or dislike?
* what do you want to do differently this month?
* what longer term goals are you working on? how are you progressing on them since last time?
* how can I best support you?

We’ll raise a proposal on Loomio once per month, as a reminder for stewards to check in with their stewardees.
